🧬 Monkeypox Detection System

(Final Year Group Project)

📌 Project Overview

The Monkeypox Detection System is a Final Year Group Project developed as part of an undergraduate degree curriculum. This project uses deep learning and transfer learning techniques to detect Monkeypox from skin lesion images. The system provides a web-based interface where users can upload images and receive AI-based predictions indicating whether the image shows Monkeypox symptoms.

🎯 Objectives

To develop an AI-assisted Monkeypox detection system

To apply transfer learning models for medical image classification

To design a secure and user-friendly web application

To support early screening and awareness using machine learning
